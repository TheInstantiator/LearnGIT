        <h3>Geting a Git Repository</h3>

        <h5>Two Ways</h5>
        <ul class="baseul">
            <li>Clone a remote repository.</li>
            <li>Initialize and create a new one.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h5>Initialize and create a new repository</h5>
        <p>
            To create a new repository for trackging you need to change directory to the root of the project. Once there you type:
        </p>
        <p>install git</p>
        <p>This creates a new subdirectory named .git that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository
            skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet. To start tracking files you need to use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>git add ( to add files to the
                <em>staging area</em> )</li>
            <li>git commit ( to commit the staging area to the main branch )</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h5>Cloning an existing repository</h5>
        <p>To clone a hosted repository you use the command
            <em>git clone &lt;URL&gt;</em>. Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of
            every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run git clone. In fact, if your
            server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to
            the state it was in when it was cloned
        </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git clone https://github.com/gitUser/gitProject
        </p>
        <p>
            That creates a directory named gitProject, initializes a .git directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository,
            and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new gitProject directory that was just
            created, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used. If you want to clone the repository
            into a directory named something other than libgit2, you can specify that as the next command-line option:
        </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git clone https://github.com/gitUser/gitProject otherDirName
        </p>
        <p>
            That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mylibgit.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h3>Recording Changes to the Repository</h3>
        </div>
        <p>
            As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you’ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively
            stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.
        </p>
        <h5>Checking the Status of Files</h5>
        <p>To check the status of the repository use the
            <em>git status</em> command.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git status
            <br> On branch master
            <br> Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
            <br> nothing to commit, working directory clean
        </p>
        <p>
            Let’s say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file. If the file didn’t exist before, and you run git status,
            you see your untracked file like so:
        </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git status
            <br> On branch master
            <br> Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
            <br> Untracked files:
            <br> (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
            <br>
            <br> README
            <br>
            <br> nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
        </p>
        <p>To begin tracking the readme use the git add command:
            <br>
            <strong>
                <em>git add README</em>
            </strong>
            <br>
            <br>If you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged to be committed:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git status
            <br> On branch master
            <br> Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
            <br> Changes to be committed:
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>(use "git reset HEAD
            <file>..." to unstage)
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pad10left"></span>
                <span class="pad10left"></span>new file: README
        </p>
        <p>You can tell that it’s staged because it’s under the “Changes to be committed” heading. The git add command takes
            a path name for either a file or a directory; if it’s a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory
            recursively. If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran git add is what will be
            in the historical snapshot.</p>
        <p>If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file.
        </p>
        <h5>Git Ignore File</h5>
        <p>Often, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked.
            In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named .gitignore. Here is an example .gitignore
            file:
        </p>
        <p>Check github for more example at:
            <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">link</a>
            <br>
            <br>It is possible to have additional .gitignore files in subdirectories. The rules in these nested .gitignore files
            apply only to the files under the directory where they are located.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ cat .gitignore
            <br> *.[oa]
            <br> *~
            <br>
            <br> # ignore all .a files
            <br> *.a
            <br>
            <br> # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
            <br> !lib.a
            <br>
            <br> # only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
            <br> /TODO
            <br>
            <br> # ignore all files in the build/ directory
            <br> build/
            <br>
            <br> # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
            <br> doc/*.txt
            <br>
            <br> # ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
            <br> doc/**/*.pdf
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in “.o” or “.a”. The second line tells Git to ignore all files
            whose names end with a tilde (~).
        </p>
        <h5>Git Commit</h5>
        <p>The simplest way to commit is to type git commit. This will bring up the default editor to type a comment. To type
            a comment inline type git commit -m "my comments".
            <br>Adding the -a option to the git commit command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked
            before doing the commit, letting you skip the git add part: </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks'
            <br> [master 83e38c7] added new benchmarks
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
        </p>
        <h5>Removing a file</h5>
        <p>The git rm command removes files from your tracked, and also removes the file from your working directory so you
            don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around. If you simply remove the file from your working directory,
            it shows up under the “Changes not staged for commit”. The next time you commit, the file will be gone and no
            longer tracked. If you modified the file and added it to the staging area already, you must force the removal
            with the -f option. This is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn’t yet been recorded
            in a snapshot and that can’t be recovered from Git.</p>
        <p>To keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore use the --cached option. (git rm --cached README).
            This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore file and accidentally staged it.</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git rm --cached README</p>
        <p>You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the git rm command. That means you can do things such
            as: </p>
        <p class="examp">$ git rm log/\*.log</p>
        <p>
            Note the backslash (\) in front of the *. This is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion in addition to your
            shell’s filename expansion.</p>
        <h5>Moving Files</h5>
        <p>
            Git doesn’t explicitly track file movement. If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed
            the file. If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like: </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git mv file_from file_to
            <br> $ git mv README.md README
            <br> $ git status
            <br> On branch master
            <br> Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
            <br> Changes to be committed:
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>(use "git reset HEAD
            <file>..." to unstage)
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pad10left"></span>
                <span class="pad10left"></span>renamed: README.md -> README
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this is equivalent to running something like this:
            <br>
        </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ mv README.md README
            <br> $ git rm README.md
            <br> $ git add README
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Git figures out that it’s a rename implicitly, so it doesn’t matter if you rename a file that way or with the mv command.
            The only real difference is that git mv is one command instead of three — it’s a convenience function. More importantly,
            you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the add/rm later, before you commit.
        </p>
        <h5>Viewing the commit Hitory</h5>
        <p>
            The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the git log command. By default, with no arguments, git log lists the commits
            made in that repository in reverse chronological order — that is, the most recent commits show up first. A huge
            number and variety of options to the git log command are available to show you exactly what you’re looking for.
            Here, we’ll show you some of the most popular.</p>

        <p>-p or --patch: Will show the difference (the patch output) introduced in each commit. You can also limit the number
            of log entries displayed, such as using -2 to show only the last two entries. You may be wondering what the difference
            is between author and committer. The author is the person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer
            is the person who last applied the work.</p>

        <p>To prevent the display of merge commits cluttering up your log history, simply add the log option --no-merges.</p>
        <p>If you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit, you can use the --stat option:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git log --stat
            <br> commit ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949

        <p>--pretty: This option changes the log output to formats other than the default. A few prebuilt options are available
            for you to use. The oneline option prints each commit on a single line, which is useful if you’re looking at
            a lot of commits. In addition, the short, full, and fuller options show the output in roughly the same format
            but with less or more information, respectivelyThe format option allows you to specify your own log output format.
            This is especially useful when you’re generating output for machine parsing</p>

                    specify your own format).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>--oneline</td>
                <td> Shorthand for --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit used together.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h5>Limiting Log Output</h5>
        <p>
            In addition to formatting the log, you can apply limit parameters to the function.
        </p>
        <p>You can do -&lt;n&gt;, where n is any integer to show the last n commits.</p>
        <p>--since and --until : example, this command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git log --since=2.weeks
        </p>
        <p>This command works with lots of formats — you can specify a specific date like "2008-01-15", or a relative date such
            as "2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago".</p>
        <p>The --author option allows you to filter on a specific author, and the --grep option lets you search for keywords
            in the commit messages.
        </p>
        <h5>Undoing Things</h5>
        <p>Be careful with some of these commands as they may undo things, but the undo cannot be undone.</p>
        <p>One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess
            up your commit message. If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them,
            and commit again using the --amend option: </p>
        <p class="examp">$ git commit --amend </p>
        <p>This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you’ve made no changes since your last commit
            (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then 40 your snapshot will look
            exactly the same, and all you’ll change is your commit message.</p>
        <p>Use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;" to unstage a file that is in the staging area.</p>
        <p>Use "git checkout &lt;file&gt;" to discard changes in working directory</p>
        <p class="caution spaceout">It’s important to understand that git checkout --
            <file> is a dangerous command. Any changes you made to that file are gone — Git just copied another file over it. Don’t
                ever use this command unless you absolutely know that you don’t want the file.</p>
        <h5>Working with Remotes</h5>
        <p>Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. To see which
            remote servers you have configured, you can run the
            <strong>git remote</strong> command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned
            your repository, you should at least see origin — that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned
            from. You can also specify
            <strong>-v</strong>, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing
            to that remote</p>
        <p>If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all. For example, a repository with multiple remotes for
            working with several collaborators might look something like this.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git remote -v
            <br> bakkdoor https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (fetch)
            <br> bakkdoor https://github.com/bakkdoor/grit (push)
            <br> cho45 https://github.com/cho45/grit (fetch)
            <br> cho45 https://github.com/cho45/grit (push)
            <br> defunkt https://github.com/defunkt/grit (fetch)
            <br> defunkt https://github.com/defunkt/grit (push)
            <br> koke git://github.com/koke/grit.git (fetch)
            <br> koke git://github.com/koke/grit.git (push)
            <br> origin git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (fetch)
            <br> origin git@github.com:mojombo/grit.git (push)
        </p>
        <p>
            This means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily. We may additionally have permission to push to
            one or more of these, though we can’t tell that here.
        </p>
        <h5>Adding a remote</h5>
        <p>Use the command
            <strong>git add
                <em>shortname</em>
                <em>url</em>
            </strong> to add a remote repository.</p>
        <p>The git clone command implicitly adds the origin remote for you.</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/ticgit</p>
        <p>to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run git
            remote add
            <em>shortname</em>
            <em>url</em>
        </p>
        <p>Now you can use the string pb on the command line in lieu of the whole URL.</p>
        <p class="examp">git fetch pb</p>
        <h5>Fetch and Pull</h5>
        <p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git fetch
            <em>remote</em>
        </p>
        <p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have
            yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge
            in or inspect at any time. </p>
        <p>
            If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. So, git fetch origin
            fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it.
        </p>
        <p class="caution spaceout">
            The git fetch command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your
            work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch you can use the git pull command to automatically fetch and then
            merge that remote branch into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you;
            and by default, the git clone command automatically sets up your local master branch to track the remote master
            branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple:
            git push
            <em>origin</em>
            <em>master</em>.</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git push origin master</p>
        <p>
            This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime.
            <p class="caution spaceout">If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will
                rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be
                allowed to push.</p>
        </p>
        <p>If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the
            <strong>git remote show origin</strong> command.</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git remote show origin
            <br> * remote origin
            <br> Fetch URL: https://github.com/TheInstantiator/boot-camp.git
            <br> Push URL: https://github.com/TheInstantiator/boot-camp.git
            <br> HEAD branch: master
            <br> Remote branch:
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span> tracked
            <br> Local branch configured for 'git pull':
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span> master merges with remote master
            <br> Local ref configured for 'git push':
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span> master pushes to master (up to date)</p>
        <h5>Renaming and Removing Remotes</h5>
        <p>You can run git remote rename to change a remote’s shortname. For instance, if you want to rename pb to paul, you
            can do so with git remote rename:</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git remote rename pb paul
            <br> $ git remote
            <br> origin
            <br> paul
        </p>
        <p class="caution spaceout">This changes all your remote-tracking branch names, too. What used to be referenced at pb/master is now at paul/master.</p>
        <p>If you want to remove a remote for some reason — you’ve moved the server or are no longer using a particular mirror,
            or perhaps a contributor isn’t contributing anymore — you can either use git remote remove or git remote rm:</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git remote remove paul
            <br> $ git remote
            <br> origin </p>
        <p class="caution spaceout">
            Once you delete the reference to a remote this way, all remote-tracking branches and configuration settings associated with
            that remote are also deleted.</p>
        <h5>Tagging</h5>
        <p>Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in history as being important. Typically people use this
            functionality to mark release points (v1.0, and so on). In this section, you’ll learn how to list the available
            tags, how to create new tags, and what the different types of tags are.</p>
        <p>Listing the available tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git tag (with optional -l or --list):</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git tag
            <br> v0.1
            <br> v1.3 </p>
        <p>Use the -l / --list to filter tags: git tag -l myTag (wildcards are supported)</p>
        <p>Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated.</p>
        <p>A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change — it’s just a pointer to a specific commit. To create
            a lightweight tag use
            <strong>git tag</strong> with no options.</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git tag myTag</p>
        <p>Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger
            name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). To
            create one use
            <strong>git tag </strong> with -a. You can also use -m to give a message like with a commit.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git tag -a v0.5 -m "Almost a version"
            <br> $ git tag
            <br> v0.5
        </p>
        <p>You can use
            <strong>git show </strong>to get info on a version.</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git show v0.5
            <br> tag v0.5

        <p>You can also tag commits after you’ve moved past them. Suppose your commit history looks like this:</p>
        <p>To tag a specific, you specify the commit checksum (or part of it) at the end of the command:</p>
        <p class="examp">24c36f9 first-commit
            <br> $ git tag -a v0.1 24c36f9
            <br> $ git show v0.1
            <br> tag v0.1

            <br> Project Started</p>
        <p>By default, the git push command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to
            a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches — you can run
            <strong>git push origin myTag</strong>. If you have a lot of tags that you want to push up at once, you can also use
            the --tags option to the git push command. This will transfer all of your tags to the remote server that are
            not already there.</p>

            <br> * [new tag] v0.5 -> v0.5
        </p>
        <p>If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do a git checkout, though this puts your
            repository in “detached HEAD” state, which has some ill side effects.</p>
        <p class="examp">$ git checkout 2.0.0
            <br> Note: checking out '2.0.0'.
            <br>
            <br> You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
            <br> changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
            <br> state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
            <br>
            <br> If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
            <br> do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>git checkout -b &lt;new-branch&gt;
            <br>
            <br> HEAD is now at 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-final</p>
        <p>
            In “detached HEAD” state, if you make changes and then create a commit, the tag will stay the same, but your new commit won’t
            belong to any branch and will be unreachable, except for by the exact commit hash. Thus, if you need to make
            changes — say you’re fixing a bug on an older version, for instance — you will generally want to create a branch:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
            <br> Switched to a new branch 'version2'</p>
        <p class="caution spaceout">
            If you do this and make a commit, your version2 branch will be slightly different than your v2.0.0 tag since it will move
            forward with your new changes, so do be careful.
        </p>
        <h5>Aliases</h5>
        <p>
            Git doesn’t automatically infer your command if you type it in partially. If you don’t want to type the entire text of each
            of the Git commands, you can easily set up an alias for each command using git config. Here are a couple of examples
            you may want to set up: </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git config --global alias.co checkout
            <br> $ git config --global alias.br branch
            <br> $ git config --global alias.ci commit
            <br> $ git config --global alias.st status
        </p>
        <p>This means that, for example, instead of typing git commit, you just need to type git ci</p>
        <p>to run an external command, rather than a Git subcommand. In that case, you start the command with a ! character.
            This is useful if you write your own tools that work with a Git repository. We can demonstrate by aliasing git
            visual to run gitk:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git config --global alias.visual '!gitk'</p>
    </div>
</body>
