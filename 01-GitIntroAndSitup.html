    <div><h1>Git Intro and Setup</h1></div>

    <div>
        <p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about
            its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems
            (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the
            changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).</p>

        <p>1-With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your
            files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed,
            Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks
            about its data more like a stream of snapshots.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>2-Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate</p>
        <hr>
        <p>3-Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s
            impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. This functionality is
            built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You can’t lose information in transit
            or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it. The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming
            is called a SHA-1 hash.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>4-Pay attention now — here is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process
            to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged: • Committed
            means that the data is safely stored in your local database. • Modified means that you have changed the file
            but have not committed it to your database yet. • Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current
            version to go into your next</p>
        <hr>
        <p>5-This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging
            area. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most
            important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer. The working
            tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database
            in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify. The staging area is a file, generally contained
            in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in
            Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well. The basic Git workflow goes something
            like this: 1. You modify files in your working tree. 2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to
            be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area. 3. You do a commit, which takes
            the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</p>

        <p>If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered committed. If it has been modified and
            was added to the staging area, it is staged. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been
            staged, it is modified.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>6-The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important
            because every Git commit uses this information, and it’s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:
            $ git config --global user.name "John Doe" $ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</p>
        <hr>
        <p>7-If you want to check your configuration settings, you can use the git config --list command to list all the settings
            Git can find at that point.</p>

        <p>You can also check what Git thinks a specific key’s value is by typing git config
            <key>: $ git config user.name John Doe</p>

        <p>If you ever need help while using Git, there are two equivalent ways to get the comprehensive manual page (manpage)
            help for any of the Git commands: $ git help
            <em>cmd</em>
        </p>

        <p>For a Git command, you can ask for the more concise “help” output with the -h or --help options, as in: $ git add
            -h</p>
