    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main
            line.
        </p>
        <p>Git doesn’t store data as a series of changesets or differences, but instead as a series of snapshots. When you make
            a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. This
            object also contains the author’s name and email, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits
            that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent
            for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.</p>
        <p>To visualize this, let’s assume that you have a directory containing three files, and you stage them all and commit.
            Staging the files:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git add README test.rb LICENSE
            <br> $ git commit -m 'The initial commit of my project'
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computes a SHA-1 checksum for each file</li>
                <li>Stores that version of the file in the Git repository (Git refers to them as blobs)</li>
                <li>Adds that checksum to the staging area</li>
            </ul>
            When you create the commit:
            <ul>
                <li>Git checksums each subdirectory and stores those tree objects in the Git repository</li>
                <li>Git then creates a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create
                    that snapshot when needed.</li>
            </ul>
            Your Git repository now contains five objects:
            <ul>
                <li>one blob for the contents of each of your three files</li>
                <li>one tree that lists the contents of the directory and specifies which file names are stored as which blobs
                </li>
                <li>one commit with the pointer to that root tree and all the commit metadata.</li>
            </ul>
            If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the commit that came immediately before it.
        </p>
        <p class="awesome">
            A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master.
            As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time
            you commit, it moves forward automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            The “master” branch in Git is not a special branch. It is exactly like any other branch. The only reason nearly every repository
            has one is that the git init command creates it by default and most people don’t bother to change it.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating a new branch</h3>
        <p>
            Creating a new branch creates a new pointer for you to move around. This pointer is to the same commit you’re currently on.
            To keep track of what branch you are currently on GIT keeps a special pointer called HEAD.
        </p>
        <p class="caution">The git branch command only creates a new branch — it doesn't switch to that branch. HEAD will still point to master.</p>
        <p>You can see where HEAD is pointing by running a simple git log command that shows you where the branch pointers are
            pointing.
        </p>

            $ git log --oneline --decorate
            <br> 01aea65 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, testing) Init Commit
        </p>
        <h3>Switching Branches</h3>
        <p>To switch to an existing branch, you run the git checkout command. Head will now point to the testing branch.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git checkout testing
            <br> Switched to branch 'testing'
            <br> M

            <br> $ git log --oneline --decorate
            <br> 01aea65 (HEAD -> testing, origin/master, master) Init Commit
        </p>
        <p class="caution">Switching branches changes files in your working directory!</p>
        <p>If we modify a file and commit we have moved forward but the master branch has stayed where it is. If we switch back
            to the master branch via
            <strong>git checkout master</strong> we will not see those changes. If we now change master and do a commit we will have
            diverged. Both of those changes are isolated in separate branches: you can switch back and forth between the
            branches and merge them together when you’re ready</p>

            Because a branch in Git is actually a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to,
            branches are cheap to create and destroy.
