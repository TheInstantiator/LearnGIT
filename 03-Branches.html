    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main
            line.
        </p>
        <p>Git doesn’t store data as a series of changesets or differences, but instead as a series of snapshots. When you make
            a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. This
            object also contains the author’s name and email, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits
            that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent
            for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.</p>
        <p>To visualize this, let’s assume that you have a directory containing three files, and you stage them all and commit.
            Staging the files:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git add README test.rb LICENSE
            <br> $ git commit -m 'The initial commit of my project'
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computes a SHA-1 checksum for each file</li>
                <li>Stores that version of the file in the Git repository (Git refers to them as blobs)</li>
                <li>Adds that checksum to the staging area</li>
            </ul>
            When you create the commit:
            <ul>
                <li>Git checksums each subdirectory and stores those tree objects in the Git repository</li>
                <li>Git then creates a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create
                    that snapshot when needed.</li>
            </ul>
            Your Git repository now contains five objects:
            <ul>
                <li>one blob for the contents of each of your three files</li>
                <li>one tree that lists the contents of the directory and specifies which file names are stored as which blobs
                </li>
                <li>one commit with the pointer to that root tree and all the commit metadata.</li>
            </ul>
            If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the commit that came immediately before it.
        </p>
        <p class="awesome spaceout">
            A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master.
            As you start making commits, you’re given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time
            you commit, it moves forward automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            The “master” branch in Git is not a special branch. It is exactly like any other branch. The only reason nearly every repository
            has one is that the git init command creates it by default and most people don’t bother to change it.
        </p>
        <h3>Creating a new branch</h3>
        <p>
            Creating a new branch creates a new pointer for you to move around. This pointer is to the same commit you’re currently on.
            To keep track of what branch you are currently on GIT keeps a special pointer called HEAD.
        </p>
        <p class="caution spaceout">The git branch command only creates a new branch — it doesn't switch to that branch. HEAD will still point to master.</p>
        <p>You can see where HEAD is pointing by running a simple git log command that shows you where the branch pointers are
            pointing.
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Switching Branches</h3>
        <p>To switch to an existing branch, you run the git checkout command. Head will now point to the testing branch.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git checkout testing
            <br> Switched to branch 'testing'

            <br> 01aea65 (HEAD -> testing, origin/master, master) Init Commit
        </p>
        <p>To create the branch and automatically switch to it you can use the following command:</p>
        <p class="examp">
            git checkout -b testing
        </p>
        <p class="caution spaceout">Switching branches changes files in your working directory! You will not see any uncommited changes.</p>
        <p>If we modify a file and commit we have moved forward but the master branch has stayed where it is. If we switch back
            to the master branch via
            <strong>git checkout master</strong> we will not see those changes. If we now change master and do a commit we will have
            diverged. Both of those changes are isolated in separate branches: you can switch back and forth between the
            branches and merge them together when you’re ready</p>

        <img src="diverge.png" alt="branch diverge" width="800" height="380">
        <p>
            Because a branch in Git is actually a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to,
            branches are cheap to create and destroy.

        <p>Example: You are branched off of master working on an issue, then you get an emergency hotfix you must do. You switch
            back to master and create the hotfix branch and make the necessary changes.
            <strong>You now have two branches off the master branch.</strong>
        </p>
        <img src="multi-br.png" alt="multi-branch" width="800" height="380">
        <p>You now roll in your hotfix by merging the changes into master with the following commands.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git checkout master
            <br> $ git merge hotfix
            <br> Updating f42c576..3a0874c
            <br> Fast-forward

        <img src="merge.png" alt="multi-branch" width="800" height="380">
        <p>You switch back to your issue and continue to work on it. You finish some more changes and commit those changes.
            You also delete the hotfix branch as it is now complete.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git branch -d hotfix
            <br> Deleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).
            <br>
            <br> $ git checkout iss53
            <br> Switched to branch "iss53"
            <br> $ vim index.html
            <br> $ git commit -a -m 'finished the new footer [issue 53]'
            <br> [iss53 ad82d7a] finished the new footer [issue 53]

        </p>
        <img src="mergetest.png" alt="multi-branch" width="800" height="380">
        <p>
            It’s worth noting here that the work you did in your hotfix branch is not contained in the files in your iss53 branch. If
            you need to pull it in, you can merge your master branch into your iss53 branch by running git merge master,
            or you can wait to integrate those changes until you decide to pull the iss53 branch back into master later.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic Merging</h3>
        <p>To merge you switch to the branch you want to merge into (usually master). Then you use the merge command.</p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git checkout master
            <br> Switched to branch 'master'
            <br> $ git merge iss53
            <br> Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
            <br> index.html | 1 +
            <br> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
        </p>
        <p>
            This looks a bit different than the hotfix merge you did earlier. In this case, your development history has diverged from
            some older point. Because the commit on the branch you’re on isn’t a direct 65 ancestor of the branch you’re
            merging in, Git has to do some work. In this case, Git does a simple threeway merge, using the two snapshots
            pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.
        </p>
        <img src="threewaymerge.png" alt="multi-branch" width="800" height="380">
        <p>
            Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and
            automatically creates
            <strong>a new commit</strong> that points to it. This is referred to as a merge commit, and is special in that it has
            more than one parent.
        </p>
        <img src="mergecommit.png" alt="multi-branch" width="800" height="380">
        <p>iss53 branch can now be removed, leaving master up to date.</p>
        <h3>Merge Conflicts</h3>
        <p>
            If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging together, Git won’t be able
            to merge them cleanly. If your fix for issue #53 modified the same part of a file as the hotfix branch, you’ll
            get a merge conflict. Git hasn’t automatically created a new merge commit. It has paused the process while you
            resolve the conflict. If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can
            run
            <strong>git status.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git status
            <br> On branch master
            <br> Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
            <br>
            <br> You have unmerged paths.
            <br>

            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>(use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
            <br>
            <br> Unmerged paths:
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>(use "git add
            <file>..." to mark resolution)
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="pad10left"></span>
                <span class="pad10left"></span>
                <span class="pad10left"></span> both modified: 03-Branches.html
                <br>
                <br> no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
                <br>
                <br> $ git status -s
                <br> UU 03-Branches.html
        </p>
        <p>
            You can fix the merge conflicts using whatever mergetool you want. After they are resolved you can stage the file. At this
            point you see:
        </p>
        <p class="examp">
            $ git add -A
            <br>
            <br> $ git status
            <br> On branch master
            <br> Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
            <br>
            <br> All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
            <br>
            <span class="pad10left"></span>(use "git commit" to conclude merge)
            <br>
            <br> Changes to be committed:
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>$ git status -s
            <br>MM 03-Branches.html
        </p>
        <p>
            You can now commit the changes and the branch will be merged into a new commit snapshot.
        </p>
        <h3>Branch Management</h3>
        <p>
            To view your current branches you can just specify git branch.
            <br> Options:
            <ul>
                <li>-v: This will show last commit information</li>
                <li>-r: will show remote branches</li>
                <li>--merged / --no-merged: this will show the last commit.
                    <p>The options described above, --merged and --no-merged will, if not given a commit or branch name as an
                        argument, show you what is, respectively, merged or not merged into your current branch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>-d: Will delete a branch with now commits, if there are unmerged commits it will throw an error.</li>
                <li>-D: will force delete a branch that has commits.</li>
                <li>-vv: will show what current remote branches you are tracking. Will give detail if branch is ahead or behind
                    upstream branch. <p class="awesome spaceout">It’s important to note that these numbers are only since the last time you fetched from each server.
                            This command does not reach out to the servers, it’s telling you about what it has cached from these
                            servers locally. If you want totally up to date ahead and behind numbers, you’ll need to fetch from all
                            your remotes right before running this. You could do that like this:<br><br>$git fetch --all; git branch -vv</p></li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <strong>checkout</strong>
                <li>git checkout --track remote/branch: checkout and track a remote branch (long version)</li>
                <li>git checkout branch
                    <p>If the branch name you’re trying to checkout (a) doesn’t exist and (b) exactly matches a name on only
                        one remote, Git will create a tracking branch for you</p>
                </li>
                <li>git checkout -b sf origin/serverfix: rename remote branch to a new name and track.</li>
                <li>$ git branch -u origin/serverfix
                    <p>If you already have a local branch and want to set it to a remote branch you just pulled down, or want
                        to change the upstream branch you’re tracking, you can use the -u or --set-upstream-to option to
                        git branch to explicitly set it at any time.</p>
                    <p class="awesome spaceout">Upstream shorthand
                        <br> When you have a tracking branch set up, you can reference its upstream branch with the @{upstream}
                        or @{u} shorthand. So if you’re on the master branch and it’s tracking origin/master, you can say
                        something like git merge @{u} instead of git merge origin/master if you wish.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Branching Workflows</h3>
        <p>
            Some common workflows that you could incorporate into your own development cycle.
        </p>
        <h5>Long Running Branches</h5>
        <p>Because Git uses a simple three-way merge, merging from one branch into another multiple times over a long period
            is generally easy to do. This means you can have several branches that are always open and that you use for different
            stages of your development cycle; you can merge regularly from some of them into others.
            <ul>
                <strong>Branches</strong>
                <li>Master</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>Approved Features</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>In Testing</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>Development</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>
                    <span class="pad10left"></span>Experimental</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Branches can commit upwards in the chain.</p>
        </p>
        <h5>Topic Branches</h5>
        <p>Topic branches, however, are useful in projects of any size. A topic branch is a short-lived branch that you create
            and use for a single particular feature or related work.</p>
        <h3>Remote Branches</h3>
        <p>Remote references are references (pointers) in your remote repositories, including branches, tags, and so on. You
            can get a full list of remote references explicitly with git ls-remote [remote], or git remote show [remote]
            for remote branches as well as more information.</p>

        <p class="examp">
            $ git ls-remote
            <br> From https://github.com/TheInstantiator/LearnGIT.git
            <br> 7c383ca182a17433bf625f27ea1c6c06b8556a4f HEAD
            <br> 7c383ca182a17433bf625f27ea1c6c06b8556a4f refs/heads/master
            <br>
            <br>$ git remote show
            <br>origin
        </p>
        <p>“origin” is not special Just like the branch name “master” does not have any special meaning in Git, neither does
            “origin”. While “master” is the default name for a starting branch when you run git init which is the only reason
            it’s widely used, “origin” is the default name for a remote when you run git clone. If you run git clone -o booyah
            instead, then you will have booyah/master as your default remote branch.</p>
        <p>You can use
            <strong>git fetch</strong> to update your remote references.</p>
        <p class="awesome spaceout">Git fetches no data but sets a remote-tracking branch called master to point to the commit that the origin has as
            its master branch.
        </p>
        <h3>Pushing</h3>
        <p>When you want to share a branch you need to push it up to the remote server</p>
        <p class="awesome spaceout">Don’t type your password every time If you’re using an HTTPS URL to push over, the Git server will ask you for your
            username and password for authentication. By default it will prompt you on the terminal for this information
            so the server can tell if you’re allowed to push.
            <br>
            <br>git config credential.helper cache: Will store your credentials temporarily.
            <br>
            <br>git config credential.helper 'cache --timeout=300': Will store your credentials temporarily with a timeout.
            <br>
            <br>git config credential.helper store: Will store your credentials permenantly.
            <br>
            <br>git config --unset credential.helper: Will resume asking for credentials.
        </p>
        <h3>Tracking Branches</h3>
        <p>Checking out a local branch from a remote-tracking branch automatically creates what is called a “tracking branch”
            (and the branch it tracks is called an “upstream branch”). Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct
            relationship to a remote branch. If you’re on a tracking branch and type git pull, Git automatically knows which
            server to fetch from and branch to merge into.</p>
